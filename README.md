# gitpod-laravel

[Create a Full Development Workspace for Laravel.](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/luizeof/gitpod-laravel)

Get fresh, task-based dev environments for any issue, branch and merge/pull request. Enter true GitOps and experience a new level of productivity.

## Remote-first. Secure by Design.

You no longer need an over-powered laptop to code, Gitpod works just as smoothly on a Chromebook or iPad. All you need is a browser.

Gitpod centralizes all source code and never stores it on insecure machines and networks.

## Get Access to a Full Linux Machine

Gitpod instantly starts a container in the cloud based on your Docker image. Tools that are required for your project are easy to install and configure.

With good defaults and full customizability, you can adjust everything to your satisfaction. More about Docker Configurations.

## Use Your Favourite VS Code Extensions

Install any VS Code extension with one click via the integrated vendor-neutral marketplace Open VSX.

## Share Running Workspaces

Sharing running workspaces makes it possible to quickly look at a workspace together with a (remote) colleague. It is similar to collaborating on Google Docs, in that you can see who is online and look at the same code and processes.

All users in one workspace share the Theia backend and the filesystem. Opened editors, terminals, and other UI state are currently not shared.
